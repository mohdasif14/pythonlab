# ---- Comparison Operators in Python ----

# Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean result (True/False)

# > : Greater than
# < : Less than
# >= : Greater than or equal to
# <= : Less than or equal to
# != : Not equal to
# == : Equal to

x, y = 70, 50  # Assigning values 70 and 50 to variables x and y

# Performing comparisons between x and y
print(x == y)   # Output: False (70 is not equal to 50)
print(x != y)   # Output: True (70 is not equal to 50)
print(x >= y)   # Output: True (70 is greater than or equal to 50)
print(x <= y)   # Output: False (70 is not less than or equal to 50)
print(x > y)    # Output: True (70 is greater than 50)
print(x < y)    # Output: False (70 is not less than 50)
